# Human-Activity-Recognition
The project aims to provide a comparative analysis of the benefits of using represen- tation methods — raw data, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), KPCA (Kernel PCA) and LE (Laplacian Eigenmaps) for classification using nonlinear methods — kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)and KSVM (Kernel Support Vector Machine). The aim is to classify the activity (Standing, Walking or Jumping) of a person based on the accelerometer data, which gives information about the acceleration along the x, y and z axis. The given problem is commonly referred to as Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The main areas of focus are as follows:

• Balancing imbalanced time series data.
• Scaling the features.

• Transforming data using sliding window.

• Comparative analysis of representation methods — raw data, PCA, KPCA, Laplacian Eigenmaps
• Classification performance comparison between kNN and KSVM

Note: The input data is provided in the input folder.
