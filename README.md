# Human-Activity-Recognition
The project aims to provide a comparative analysis of the benefits of using representation methods — raw data, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), KPCA (Kernel PCA) and LE (Laplacian Eigenmaps) for classification using nonlinear methods — kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)and KSVM (Kernel Support Vector Machine). The aim is to classify the activity (Standing, Walking or Jumping) of a person based on the accelerometer data, which gives information about the acceleration along the x, y and z axis. The given problem is commonly referred to as Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The main areas of focus are as follows:

• Balancing imbalanced time series data.

• Scaling the features.

• Transforming data using sliding window.

• Comparative analysis of representation methods — raw data, PCA, KPCA, Laplacian Eigenmaps.

• Classification performance comparison between k- Nearest Neighbors and kernel SVM.

The following specifications will help run the project:

• The input data is provided in the input folder.

• Download the zip folder and run the jupyter notebook— *script-HAR.ipynb* cell by cell.

• The results for the project are available in the *results* folder.
